## SQL Project Repository

Hello, and welcome to my SQL project repository! This space houses examples of SQL queries I've developed for solo projects, as well as assignments completed during data analytics courses and projects involving machine learning. Below, you'll find a brief overview of some highlighted projects, along with any relevant data visualizations created using tools like Tableau.

Feel free to explore the repository and examine the SQL scripts. If you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to reach out.

## Highlights

### Top 50 Spotify Songs in 2021 Analysis
For this project, I started with a very small dataset to get my hands dirty with SQL queries after learning from freecodecamp's 4-hour free SQL course. I've used [SQLiteOnline](https://sqliteonline.com/) to import the data and perform simple queries.

**Dataset Source:** [Kaggle - Spotify Top 50 Songs in 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equinxx/spotify-top-50-songs-in-2021)
